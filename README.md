# M42-to-2inch-telescope-adapter
STL files to 3D print adapters to put your camera (M42x1 adapter) to a 2" telescope mount 

M42x1 is a very common mount for old cameras and lenses. You can find adapters for almost all modern cameras to adapt old M42 lenses. Normally these adapters are also very cheap (except for the Nikon F mount that needs an extra lens in it). 

Using a camera (DSLR or DSLM) on a telescope with a bigger backfocus can sometimes be problematic. So it was for me, trying to adapt a Fujifilm X system to my Skywatcher Evostar 72ED without a field flattener. The backfocus of this telescope is quite long (about 140mm with the focuser moved completely in). I already had a M42x1 adapter and so I created a 3D printable adapter that screws into the M42x1 adapter on the camera side and then slides into the 2" mount on the telescope side. Depending on how much backfocus you need and how much room inside the telescope tube is, you need maybe different lengths of this adapter. So I created 3 different sizes.

M42x1to2inch-35mm.stl
M42x1to2inch-55mm.stl
M42x1to2inch_110mm.stl

The first one is the short 35mm version, the second is 55mm long and the third one is 110mm long. 

So there should be enough room to get focus with your camera.
